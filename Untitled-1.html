                <h2>1. Quantum Computing</h2>
                <p>Imagine you're trying to solve a really tough puzzle. A regular computer would
                look at each piece one by one, trying different possibilities until it finds the right solution.
                But a <strong>quantum computer</strong>can look at all pieces at the same time 
                because it can exist in many states simultaneously(this is called <em>superposition
                </em>). It's like having a superpower to explore possible answers instead oif being bounded by just one by one like in the everyday world.
                This ability could make quantum computers much faster at certain problems, but it's still early in development and difficult to fully harness.</p>

            <div class="concept">
                <h2>2. Machine Learning & Deep Learning</h2>
                <p>Think of <strong>machine learning</strong> like teaching a child to recognize objects.If you show the child many pictures of dogs and say "this is a dog,"
                the child will start recognizing patterns(like fur,four legs, etc.) and evenytually be able to identify a dog in new pictures. In machine learning, we "train"
            a computer by showing a lot of examples (data) and letting it learn the patterns.</p>
                    <p><strong>Deep learning</strong> is a special kind of machine learning that uses
                    a series of steps (like a brain with many layers of neurons) to learn even more complex
                    patterns. it's like the difference between a simple machine that can recognize a dog and
                a super-smart system that can also recognize emotions in faces or understand spoken language. it's likme teaching a computer to do many tasks by exposing it to lots of data.
